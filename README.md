This is a keyboard synthesizer website. The keyboard has one octave, and can be played either with the mouse or the computer keyboard. You can change the wavetype of the oscillator (sine, square, etc) as well as the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release) and of course the volume.

Note: at this point the keyboard is not fully functional in chrome. We recommend using Firefox instead.

This project is by Diadem Shoukralla and Ismael Ghanim.
